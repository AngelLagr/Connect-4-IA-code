# Puissance4-IA-code
My python code for the "Puissance4 IA" project

The goal was to create with my class a competition : Create the best Puissance4's script and beat everyone !

# But now i want to train an IA to play against this script and beat it.

I had some problem at first with my script so I switch with a training script that I found on internet.

Here's how a grid of the Puissance4's game is coded in python
